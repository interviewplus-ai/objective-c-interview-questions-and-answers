## 1. How do you declare and initialize a variable in Objective-C?

Answer:

```objective
// Declaration
NSString *name;

// Initialization
name = @"John Doe";
```

## 2. How do you define a method in Objective-C?

Answer:

```objective
// Method declaration in header file (.h)
- (void)printMessage;

// Method implementation in implementation file (.m)
- (void)printMessage {
    NSLog(@"Hello, World!");
}
```

## 3. How do you create a class in Objective-C?

Answer:

```objective
// Header file (.h)
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface MyClass : NSObject

- (void)myMethod;

@end

// Implementation file (.m)
@implementation MyClass

- (void)myMethod {
    NSLog(@"My method");
}

@end
```

## 4. How do you create an instance of a class in Objective-C?

Answer:

```objective
MyClass *myObject = [[MyClass alloc] init];
```

## 5. How do you allocate and deallocate memory in Objective-C?

Answer:

```objective
MyClass *myObject = [[MyClass alloc] init];
// Use myObject

[myObject release];
myObject = nil;
```

## 6. How do you define properties in Objective-C?

Answer:

```objective
@interface MyClass : NSObject

@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *name;
@property (nonatomic, assign) NSInteger age;

@end
```

## 7. How do you use synthesized properties in Objective-C?

Answer:

```objective
@interface MyClass : NSObject

@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *name;

@end

// Implementation
@implementation MyClass

@synthesize name;

@end
```

## 8. How do you work with arrays in Objective-C?

Answer:

```objective
NSArray *myArray = @[@"Apple", @"Banana", @"Orange"];

// Accessing elements
NSString *firstElement = myArray[0];

// Iterating through elements
for (NSString *item in myArray) {
    NSLog(@"%@", item);
}
```

## 9. How do you work with dictionaries in Objective-C?

Answer:

```objective
NSDictionary *myDict = @{@"key1": @"value1", @"key2": @"value2"};

// Accessing values
NSString *value = myDict[@"key1"];

// Iterating through key-value pairs
for (NSString *key in myDict) {
    NSString *value = myDict[key];
    NSLog(@"%@: %@", key, value);
}
```

## 10. How do you handle exceptions in Objective-C?

Answer:

```objective
@try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
}
@catch (NSException *exception) {
    NSLog(@"Exception: %@", exception.reason);
}
@finally {
    // Code to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not
}
```

## 11. How do you work with blocks in Objective-C?

Answer:

```objective
typedef void (^CompletionBlock)(BOOL success);

- (void)performTaskWithCompletion:(CompletionBlock)completion {
    // Perform task
    BOOL success = YES;

    // Invoke completion block
    completion(success);
}

// Usage
[self performTaskWithCompletion:^(BOOL success) {
    if (success) {
        NSLog(@"Task completed successfully.");
    } else {
        NSLog(@"Task failed.");
    }
}];
```

## 12. How do you handle asynchronous operations in Objective-C?

Answer:

```objective
NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@"https://api.example.com/data"];
NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:url];

NSURLSession *session = [NSURLSession sharedSession];
NSURLSessionDataTask *task = [session dataTaskWithRequest:request completionHandler:^(NSData *data, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {
    if (error) {
        NSLog(@"Error: %@", error.localizedDescription);
    } else {
        // Process the received data
    }
}];

[task resume];
```

## 13. How do you perform sorting of an array in Objective-C?

Answer:

```objective
NSMutableArray *myArray = [@[@3, @1, @2] mutableCopy];
[myArray sortUsingSelector:@selector(compare:)];

NSLog(@"%@", myArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
```
